# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


CURRENCY CONVERTER APP

PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Currency Converter App is a web-based application built using React JS that allows users to quickly and easily convert one currency into another. It retrieves real-time exchange rates from an external API and offers a seamless, user-friendly experience for individuals who need up-to-date currency conversions. This app is particularly useful for travelers, international businesses, and anyone dealing with foreign currency transactions.

KEY FEATURES

- Real-Time Conversion: Leverages live data from a trusted API to provide accurate, up-to-date currency conversion rates.
- Multi-Currency Support: Convert between a wide range of currencies, including popular ones like USD, EUR, GBP, and others.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI designed to deliver a smooth user experience, with input validation to ensure users enter valid amounts.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that works across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

TECHNOLOGY STACK

- Frontend: React JS, styled with CSS for an intuitive user experience.
- API: Exchange rate data is fetched from [API Name] to provide real-time currency conversion.
- State Management: React's useState and useEffect hooks are employed to manage application state and API requests.
- Deployment: The application is deployed using Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable access.

HOW IT WORKS

1. The user selects the currencies they wish to convert from and to.
2. The user inputs the amount they wish to convert.
3. The app fetches the latest exchange rates from the API and displays the converted value.
4. Users can also view recent conversions in the history section.
